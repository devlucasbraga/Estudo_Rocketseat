        <h2>The Return of HTML-Centric Development</h2>
        <p>
          With the rise of CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation,
          developers started relying heavily on class-based styling, moving away
          from the traditional HTML-centric development. However, Tailwind CSS
          brings back the importance of HTML by leveraging utility classes that
          directly correspond to HTML attributes and elements. This approach
          promotes semantic HTML and makes the code more readable, maintainable,
          and accessible. By using Tailwind CSS, you no longer need to dig
          through a separate CSS file to understand the stylingâ€”it's all right
          there in your HTML markup.
        </p>

            "Tailwind CSS has not only improved my development workflow but also
            my understanding of HTML and CSS. The utility-first approach allows
            me to focus on the structure and semantics of my code while
            effortlessly styling elements. It's a game-changer!"
